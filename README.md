Spam Detection NLP Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Spam Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam (Ham)." Spam detection is a critical application in filtering unwanted or malicious messages in emails, SMS, or chat systems.

Features

- Dataset: A labeled dataset of messages, with examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages.
- Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming text data for analysis.
- Feature Extraction: Representing text as numerical data using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.
- Modeling: Training machine learning models to classify messages.
- Evaluation: Measuring the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
- Deployment: A simple interface or API for detecting spam in real-time.


Libraries and Tools Used

- NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, or Scikit-learn for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for building and training models.
- Exploration: Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.


            Key Techniques

Text Preprocessing:
- Tokenization
- Stop-word removal
- Lowercasing
- Lemmatization or stemming


Feature Extraction:
- Word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe
